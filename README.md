# Time-varying-Channel-estimation
This is a simulation of problem 13.3 from Fundamentals of statistical signal processing by Stevan M kay 
In this report, a time varying channel estimation problem was realized by using Kalman Filters.
 In the first part of the study, the introduction and some definitions were given. 
In the second part, the problem was analysed and some useful theoretical and practical information were given. 
In the third part of the study, the method Kalman Filters were explained and the simulation algorithm was given. 
In the last part of the study the simulation results were given and these results were explained and commented.
